          <p>Surrounding yourself with people who want you to stay healthy is really important. Try to spend time with friends and family who encourage you to make good choices. If you ever feel tempted to use drugs, talk to someone you trust, like a friend, teacher, therapist, social worker, family or counselor. They can help you think clearly and remind you of your goals. Remember, there are people who care about you and want to help you stay safe. </p>

          <h2 className="card-title">Part 3: Be Extra Careful if You Ever Feel Tempted </h2>
          <p>If you’re ever around drugs, be very careful. First, never use it alone. Having someone nearby means they can help if something goes wrong. Start with a tiny amount if you’re ever tempted and go very slowly. Never mix drugs with alcohol because it can be extremely dangerous. It’s also smart to have something called naloxone, a medicine that can reverse an overdose, nearby in case someone overdoses. Learn how to use it or ask an adult to keep it and help if needed. </p>

          <p>Taking care of your body and mind is one of the best ways to stay strong against cravings. Try to eat healthy foods, get regular exercise, and get plenty of sleep so you feel your best. Staying active, like playing sports, dancing, or even walking, can boost your mood and reduce stress. Also, avoid places or situations where you know drugs might be present.</p>
